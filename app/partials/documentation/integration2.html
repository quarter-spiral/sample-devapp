This guide assumes that you already [display player data](/#/documentation/integration) in your game.

Our next step is to store the high score with Mission Kontrol. This way our high score will never be lost again. Mission Kontrol is able of holding data for each player for you. To leverage that we are going to change the way we store the high score in the controller. First let's save the ``qs`` object we get after initializing the SDK. Change the initialization code to:

```javascript
var qs = null;
QS.setup().then(function (initializedQs) {
  qs = initializedQs;
  qs.retrievePlayerInfo().then(function (player) {
    $scope.playerName = player.name;
    $scope.$apply()
  });
})
```

so that it looks like this:

![Updates initialization](/img/documentation/integration_17.jpg)

Now find the first line of the ``$scope.reset`` function where the high score is currently saved:

![Old high score storage](/img/documentation/integration_18.jpg)

We will change that so save the score to Mission Kontrol like this:

```javascript
if ($scope.points > $scope.highScore) {
  $scope.highScore = $scope.points;
  qs.setPlayerData('highScore', $scope.highScore);
}
```

so the whole function is now reading:

![New high score storage](/img/documentation/integration_19.jpg)

With just one line

```javascript
qs.setPlayerData('highScore', $scope.highScore);
```

we are now storing the high score in the cloud! Actually we are cheating a little bit here as we use the ``qs`` object without any checks even is the initialization has not yet happened. We encourage you to use a more clever approach in your game or at least check if the ``qs`` variable is already set. But for this demo it will do.

Let's do the last step and make sure we pick up on the stored value when the page is loaded. We are going to change the initialization one last time. Right before the end of the ``then`` function of the ``setup`` call add this code:

```javascript
qs.retrievePlayerData().then(function (data) {
  if (data.highScore) {
    $scope.highScore = data.highScore;
    $scope.$apply();
  }
});
```

that should now look like this:

![Final initialization code](/img/documentation/integration_20.jpg)

After updating the fiddle, reloading the game on facebook and playing for a while you should get a new high score when you click on "Start over" after losing a game. Now go and reload the page aaaaand tada! You should see your high score magicaly showing up even after the reload like this:

![Loaded high score](/img/documentation/integration_21.jpg)

To finish off this guide we will add a social twist to the high score integrate it with the friend bar. Head over to Mission Kontrol and open the "Settings / Friendbar" page

![Open friendbar settings](/img/documentation/integration_22.jpg)

Now enter "High Score" as the top value's label and ``highScore`` (as the name we used in our JavaScript code) as it's key. After that hit "Update".

![Friendbar settings](/img/documentation/integration_23.jpg)

That is all you have to do! Now when you and your friends are playing the game you can see each others high scores in the friend bar. You can even sort your friends by high score with no extra effort.

And with that we are done. You have learned how to get basic information about the player like his name and how to use Mission Kontrol as a data store for your game. In the end we even added a social leader board to your game with very little effort.

If we got you hooked have a look at our SDK documentation for [HTML5](/#/documentation/sdkHtml) and [Flash](/#/documentation/sdkFlash) to learn about all the tricks Mission Kontrol has up it's sleeves and super charge your game with it.

And of course let us know any question you have or what ever else might be on your mind. We are happy to hear from you: [support@quarterspiral.com](mailto:support@quarterspiral.com)

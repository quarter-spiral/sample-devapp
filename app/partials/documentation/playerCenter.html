The Player API handles everything player related in our system. This is the service that will handle most of the things you need from within a game.

### Base URL

``https://players.quarterspiral.com/``

### Retrieve public information about a player

Does not need any authentication. The response from this endpoint is very close to the non-public information about players (**GET** ``/:UUID:``) . It omits any sensible data (e.g. venue specific IDs), though.

#### Request

**GET** ``/public/:UUID:``

##### Parameters

- **UUID** [REQUIRED]: The UUID of the player you want to retrieve information about.

##### Body

Empty.

#### Response

##### Body

JSON encoded object like this:

```javascript
{
  "uuid": "some-uuid",
  "venues": {
    "facebook": {
      "name": "The Peter"
    },
    "spiral-galaxy": {
      "name": "Peter Smith"
    }
  }
}
```

All information under the ``venues`` is present for each venue this player is playing a Quarter Spiral game on.

### List player's friends public information

This endpoint does not need any authentication and resembles closely the ``List player's friends`` endpoint (**GET** to ``/:UUID:/friends``) which needs to be called authenticated over OAuth. This endpoint will only return publicly available information about friends.

#### Request

**GET** ``/public/:UUID:/friends``

##### Parameters

- **UUID** [REQUIRED]: The UUID of the player who's friends you want to retrieve.

##### Body

Empty

#### Response

Please note that the list of friends always includes the requester itself, too.

##### Body

JSON encoded object mapping a friend's UUID to an object of player info (see *Retrieve public information about a player*) like this:

```javascript
{
  "some-uuid":  {
    "uuid": "some-uuid",
    "facebook": {
      "name": "The Peter"
    },
    "spiral-galaxy": {
      "name": "Peter Smith"
    }
  },
  "other-uuid": {
    …
  }
}
```

### List the games a player plays

This endpoint does not need authentication.

#### Request

**GET** to ``/public/:UUID:/games``

##### Parameters

##### Body

JSON encoded Object with additional options:

* **venue**: If set only games that the player play's on the given venue will be listed

#### Response

JSON encoded object of games in the way the ``devcenter-backend`` public API returns game lists.

### Retrieve information about a player

#### Request

**GET** ``/:UUID:``

##### Parameters


##### Body

Empty.

#### Response

    },
    "spiral-galaxy": {
      "id": "87233",
      "name": "Peter Smith"
    }
  }
}
```

All information under the ``venues`` is present for each venue this player is playing a Quarter Spiral game on.

### List player's friends

#### Request

**GET** ``/:UUID:/friends``

##### Parameters

- **UUID** [REQUIRED]: The UUID of the player who's friends you want to retrieve.

##### Body

JSON encoded object with further options:

* **game**: If present only displays friends who play the game with the given UUID
* **meta**: An array of keys of player meta data that is added to each friend. This parameter requires the game parameter to be set as the meta data is stored per player/game pair.

#### Response

Please note that the list of friends always includes the requester itself, too.

##### Body

JSON encoded object mapping a friend's UUID to an object of player info (see *Retrieve information about a player*) like this:

```javascript
{
  "some-uuid":  {
    "uuid": "some-uuid",
    "facebook": {
      "id": "1234",
      "name": "The Peter"
    },
    "spiral-galaxy": {
      "id": "87233",
      "name": "Peter Smith"
    }
  },
  "other-uuid": {
    …
  }
}
```

If the ``meta`` parameter is set the meta results will be added as another venue called ``meta`` like this:

```javascript
{
  "some-uuid":  {
    "uuid": "some-uuid",
    "facebook": {
      "id": "1234",
      "name": "The Peter"
    },
    "spiral-galaxy": {
      "id": "87233",
      "name": "Peter Smith"
    },
    "meta": {
      "highScore": 100,
      "lastLevel": "Good Chamber"
    }
  },
  "other-uuid": {
    …
  }
}
```

### [DEPRECATED] List the games a player plays

### Set player's game meta data

#### Request

**PUT** to ``/:PLAYER-UUID:/games/:GAME-UUID:/meta-data/:KEY:``

##### Parameters

- **PLAYER-UUID** [REQUIRED]: The UUID of the player who you want to set the meta data for
- **GAME-UUID** [REQUIRED]: The UUID of a game the you want to set the meta data for
- **KEY** [OPTIONAL] A key name in the metadata object. If set only this key will be updated.

##### Body

JSON encoded object of meta data under a ``meta`` key like this:

```javascript
{
  "meta": {
    "highscore": 100,
    "levelsCompleted": "[1,2,3]",
    "playedTutorial": true
  }
}
```

Only numbers, boolean values and strings are accepted as meta data values. If you need more complex types as arrays and objects you can always encode them as strings, e.g. in JSON notation.

If the ``KEY`` parameter is set you still provide an object as the body. Nonetheless, the request will only change the specified key of the metadata. E.g. if you only want to change the high score to ``112``, you can issue a **PUT** to ``/:PLAYER-UUID:/games/:GAME-UUID:/meta-data/highscore`` with a JSON encoded body of this object:

```javascript
{
  "meta": {
    "highscore": 110
  }
}
```

#### Response

Returns status code 200 if the data was set successfully. Returns status code 415 if wrong data types are used in the meta data.

##### Body

JSON encoded meta data object of the changed meta data. This always returns the whole meta data object even when a ``KEY`` parameter was present.

Example:

```javascript
{
  "meta": {
    "highscore": 110,
    "levelsCompleted": "[1,2,3]",
    "playedTutorial": true
  }
}
```

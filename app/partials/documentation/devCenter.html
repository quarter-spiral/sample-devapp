#### Embedded

**Key**: ``embedded``

A white-label venue to embed your game on any website.

Comes with a ``code`` value in the computed configuration that has the complete embed code you need to embed in your website.


### General Configuration

The ``configuration`` object also contains the following properties:

### ``sizes`` [OPTIONAL]

An array that indicates the allowed sizes for the game. Each object in the array must have a ``width`` and ``height`` property. For games using the fluid canvas only the first element of the array is used as a minimal width and height.

#### Examples

```javascript
"configuration": {…, "sizes": [{"width": 600, "height": 400}, {"width": 320, "height": 200}]}
```

### ``fluid-size`` [OPTIONAL]

Boolean property that indicates if a fluid canvas is used. If this property is ``falsy`` a canvas with a fixed size will be used.

#### Examples

```javascript
"configuration": {…, "fluid-size": true}
```

Use the HTML SDK to quickly and easily integrate your HTML5 game with the various Quarter Spiral APIs.

### Setup

Include this ``script`` tag on every page you want to use the SDK from:

```html
&lt;script src="https://sdk.quarterspiral.com/javascripts/sdk.js" type="text/javascript">&lt;/script>
```

Now initialize the SDK in your JavaScript:

```javascript
QS.setup().then(function (qs) {
    â€¦
})
```

Inside of that function you now have access to the ``qs`` objects which comes with some nifty helpers to make your life easier.

**Make sure to call ``QS.setup`` only once on every page!**

If a player is not logged in when playing the game (e.g. when playing through an embed on a third party website) the SDK will not setup! It will reject the promise. Handle that case like this:

```javascript
QS.setup().then(function (qs) {
  // success!
}, function(error) {
  // Not setup. Log the reason:
  console.log(error.message)
})
```

### Retrieve information about the player

```javascript
QS.setup().then(function (qs) {
  qs.retrievePlayerInfo().then(function (player) {
    console.log("Current player:")
    console.log("Name", player.name)
    console.log("Email", player.email)
  }
})
```

The ``retrievePlayerInfo`` call gives you a player object that holds information about the currently logged in player. You can access it's ``name``, ``email`` and ``uuid`` which is it's unique identifier within the Quarter Spiral universe.

In some cases an email address might not be present. For the time being we return ``unknown@example.com`` in these cases but this will be subject to change.

### Manage player data

Quarter Spiral lets you save data for every player that plays your game.

```javascript
QS.setup().then(function (qs) {
  qs.setPlayerData(
    {tutorialPlayed: true, highScore: 105}
  ).then(function (data) {
    console.log("Player data saved.")
    console.log("Saved data:", data)
  })
})
```

This call will overwrite all data that was previously stored for this player. If you only want to adjust a single value you can do that:

```javascript
QS.setup().then(function (qs) {
  qs.setPlayerData('highScore', 120).then(function (data) {
    console.log("Player data saved.")
    console.log("Saved data:", data)
  })
})
```

Even of you only set a single value you will always get back the full set of stored data for that player in the ``then`` phase.

There is also a convenient way to retrieve the current player's data:

```javascript
QS.setup().then(function (qs) {
  qs.retrievePlayerData().then(function (data) {
    console.log("Player data loaded:", data)
  })
})
```

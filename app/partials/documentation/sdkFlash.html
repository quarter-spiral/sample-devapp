# Quarter Spiral Flash SDK

The easy way to integrate your game with the Quarter Spiral universe. Find the library's source code on [Github](https://github.com/quarter-spiral/flash-sdk-lib).

## Setup

Add the ``Quarter Spiral SDK.swc`` file to the build path of your app. You can find the latest version [here](https://github.com/quarter-spiral/flash-sdk-lib/raw/master/bin/Quarter%20Spiral%20SDK.swc).

## First steps

To start using our SDK you first need to obtain an instance of the SDK. You can get one easily like this:

```as3
  import com.quarterspiral.sdk.*;
  â€¦
  var qsSdk:Sdk = SdkFactory.getInstance(Starling.current.nativeStage.root.loaderInfo);
```

In the code above we are using the [Starling]() game framework as an example. It doesn't matter if you use a framework at all or which one you use. Just make sure to pass in the ``LoaderInfo`` object to the ``getInstance`` method of the ``SdkFactory`` which comes with the flash params of your project. Using your main stage has proven to be a good start.

## Information about a player

To get information about the current player the SDK provides you with the ``playerInformation`` property that returns a ``PlayerInformation`` object that gives you insight on the player's name, email address and internal id within the Quarter Spiral universe.

```as3
  trace(qsSdk.playerInformation.name);
  trace(qsSdk.playerInformation.email);
  trace(qsSdk.playerInformation.uuid);
```

As this information is going to be retrieved asynchronously, the ``playerInformation`` can return ``null`` as long as the retrieval process hat not yet been completed. You can either check if the retrieval is done already like this:

```as3
  if (qsSdk.playerInformationReady) {
    trace(qsSdk.playerInformation.name);
  }
```

or you can even be notified whenever the information becomes available

```as3
  qsSdk.onPlayerInformationReady(function(playerInformation:PlayerInformation):void {
    trace(playerInformation.name);
  });
```

Please note, that ``qsSdk.playerInformationReady`` will not trigger the retrieval process. Make sure that you call ``qsSdk.playerInformation`` once before to trigger the process.

## Manage data for players

### Reading data

Quarter Spiral allows you to store arbitrary data for any of your players. That data comes in form of an ordinary ``Dictionary`` and can be read like this:

```as3
  trace(qsSdk.playerData['highScore']);
```

As this information is going to be retrieved asynchronously, the ``playerData`` can return ``null`` as long as the retrieval process hat not yet been completed. You can either check if the retrieval is done already like this:

```as3
  if (qsSdk.playerDataReady) {
    trace(qsSdk.playerData['highScore']);
  }
```

or you can even be notified whenever the data becomes available

```as3
  qsSdk.onPlayerDataReady(function(playerData:Dictionary):void {
    trace(playerData['highScore']);
  });
```

Please note, that ``qsSdk.playerDataReady`` will not trigger the retrieval process. Make sure that you call ``qsSdk.playerData`` once before to trigger the process.

### Writing data

Writing data back to Quarter Spiral can be done like this:

```as3
  var data:Dictionary = new Dictionary();
  data['highScore'] = 12345;
  data['lastLevel'] = "Tower of Happiness";
  qsSdk.setPlayerData(data);
```

If you only want to write a single attribute of the data without touching the rest you can do that like this:

```as3
  qsSdk.setPlayerData("highScore", 67890);
```

Please note, that all writing operations will be queued up until the SDK becomes ready. When you try to carry out writing operations while an older one is still in progress, that leads to queuing as well.

For more fine grained control over the result of all writing operations a ``SetPlayerDataResponse`` is returned from the ``setPlayerData`` method. This response can be used to determine if an operation has already been completed and if it was successful or not.

## Testing

To test your game with the Quarter Spiral SDK you can activate a test mode on the ``SdkFactory``. As a result of that you will get an instance of ``DomSdk`` as your SDK which uses a ``MockDomSdkDriver`` internally. Use it like this:

```as3
  SdkFactory.testing = true;
  var sdk:DomSdk = DomSdk(SdkFactory.getInstance("http://canvas.example.com"));
  sdk.driver.playerInformation = new PlayerInformation("1111-2222-3333", "Peter", "peter@example.com");
  //sdk.playerInformation will now return the information we set above
```

You have to set ``SdkFactory.testing`` before **any** call to ``SdkFactory.getinstance``. Also please note that the ``MockDomSdkDriver`` is as dumb as possible. You have to manage all the state yourself.

Before you can use all the Quarter Spiral super powers like Facebook integration or social gaming features you need to setup your game on our developer platform Mission Kontrol. This guide walks you through all of the necessary three steps. You will learn how to:

1. Sign up as a developer
2. Setup your game

Please keep in mind that we are evolving our platform close to the speed of light. If some screens have changed while our documentation squad was resting please tell us! And never hesitate to contact us whenever something is unclear or you just have any question: support@quarterspiral.com

## Sign up as a developer

To become a Quarter Spiral developer first head to the top right of this very page and follow the "Log in" link.

![Log in link](/img/documentation/signup_1.jpg)

On the bottom of the log in form there is a link that leads you directly to the sign up page.

And after hammering in your details you are just one click away from being a legit Quarter Spiral astronaut. Do it!

![Sign up form](/img/documentation/signup_3.jpg)

Now just enter your credentials once more and log in.

Just head back to [Mission Kontrol](https://mk.quarterspiral.com/) after that and click the "Log in" link in to top right again.

On the next screen you have to grant Mission Kontroll access to your Quarter Spiral account.

Well done, you should see your Mission Kontrol dashboard now. We are ready to setup your game next!

## Setup your game

In order to show you around we have put together a small game that serves as a simple example. Meet: [Rock-paper-scissors-lizard-Spock](http://jsfiddle.net/walski/LnmfB/embedded/result/).

Behind the scenes the game is built with HTML5 using [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/) but don't care too much right now. No matter if you are a Flash or HTML5 developer we got you covered along the way. Whenever we hit spot where our SDK diverges a bit for those two underlying platforms we will let you know. And you can always look things up real quick in our [SDK docs](/#/documentation/sdkIntro).

Now let's go.

Start with clicking the "Add a new game" button in Mission Kontrol.

Now enter the name and description of your game and click "Continue".

Before we can start playing now we need to add a *Build* to Mission Kontrol. A build is one version of your game, either a SWF file if Flash is your thing or a URL to your HTML5 game. As our example uses HTML5 first thing we need is an exclusive URL for your version of the game.

To get one head back to the [example game](http://jsfiddle.net/walski/LnmfB/embedded/result/). Once you are there click the little "+" icon in the top right.

A new page will open up. Click on the "Fork" link in the top tool bar.

You will be redirected to a new URL, this is already a unique copy of the game that we will hack on later. But for now we just need one more step to get the URL of the actual game, not it's source code which you are looking at right now. For that click on the small down arrow right next to "Share" in the tool bar. Then copy the "full screen result" URL to your clipboard.

Back at Mission Kontrol click the "Builds" link

![Builds link](/img/documentation/game_setup_6.jpg)

In the new screen select HTML5, then paste the game's URL you have copied before in the field and hit save.

After saving the build's details Mission Kontrol presents you the "Venue" screen.

We will use that in a minute to bring your game to Facebook. But before we head there lets sum up what we just did:

1. We have created a new game and entered it's name and details. You can always go back there by clicking on "Settings / Name & Description" ![Configuration link](/img/documentation/game_setup_9.jpg)
2. After forking the game we have setup a build in Mission Kontrol. Upload new builds at any time by clicking on "Files / Builds" ![Builds link](/img/documentation/game_setup_10.jpg)
3. As a last step we arrived at the venues screen which you can reach by clicking at "Settings / Venues" ![Venues link](/img/documentation/game_setup_11.jpg)

Not too bad! And if you are not already exploding to get to know how to get our precious little sample game up and running on Facebook be a good developer and upload some screenshots of the game to Mission Kontrol. By now we are very confident that you will find out how on your own but here is a hint to get started:

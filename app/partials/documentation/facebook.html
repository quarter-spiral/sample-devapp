This guide assumes that you have already [set up a game](/#/documentation/setup).

To play our game on Facebook we need to configure two different things: An application on Facebook itself and our Facebook venue in Mission Kontrol. Let's do this one step at a time.

First we will setup Facebook. Make sure that you are logged in to Facebook with your Facebook account. If you need help creating a Facebook account, see [Facebook's guide](https://www.facebook.com/help/188157731232424/).

Head over to the developer section of Facebook at: [http://developers.facebook.com](http://developers.facebook.com). If this is the first time developing on Facebook you need to register as a developer first. Click the "Register now" button in the top right.

Now read through Facebook's platform and privacy policies and hit "Continue" to accept them.

To proceed as a developer on Facebook you must provide a phone number where you can recieve a text message. Enter your number and hit "Continue".

![Enter phone number form](/img/documentation/facebook_3.jpg)

Facebook will send you a text with a confirmation code. Enter this code and hit "Confirm".

Now set the privacy level of your phone number on your normal Facebook profile. Once you are done click "Continue".

As a last step to become a Facebook platform developer you can supply some optional information about yourself and decide if you want to get the developer newsletter from Facebook.

![Additional information form](/img/documentation/facebook_6.jpg)

Now the registration is complete, just hit "Done".

You will find yourself at the Facebook developer dashboard. As a next step we need to set up our game as an application on Facebook. Click the button labeled "Create New App" on the top right of the screen.

In the form that opens up enter your game's and click "Continue". Leave the rest of the form blank.

Confirm the CAPTCHA and hit "Continue" to complete the application set up.

Now you are one step closer to game developer domination! Facebook takes you to the developer dashboard for your game. Two pieces of information are especially important to us: The "App ID" and "App Secret" fields in the header of the page. You need to paste those two values into Mission Kontrol before your game can be served to Facebook.

![App ID and App Secret](/img/documentation/facebook_11.jpg)

We're showing only the first 5 characters of both fields in the screenshot. Those two values are to your application on Facebook what keys are to your house. They grant whoever is posession of them access to the app and it's settings. In order to enable your game on Facebook in Mission Kontrol we need those keys to power our social features like the Friend Bar. So we ask you to trust us here and are honored if you do. We promise to be the most pleasant guests you ever had in your house! We'll clean the bathroom and bake you cookies.

**Be sure to consider carefully who are you giving your Facebook application's credentials to.**

To proceed we need to copy the app ID and secret over to Mission Kontrol. First copy the application ID from the Facebook page, open Mission Kontrol in a new tab and navigate to the "Venues" section for your game and click the "Configuration" link next to Facebook.

![Facebook configuration link](/img/documentation/facebook_12.jpg)

Now paste in the app ID from Facebook in box 2, go back to Facebook, copy the app secret and then paste it into box 3.

Once that is done now copy the URL displayed in box 1. Make sure to copy the whole thing including the ``?`` at the end. When done, click "Upgrade Facebook Settings".

![Facebook configuration form](/img/documentation/facebook_13.jpg)

As a last step of configuration you now need to tell Facebook where it can find your app and ensure that your app is in the access restricted Sandbox mode. Go back to your Facebook tab and first set "Sandbox Mode" to "Enabled". Then click on the "App on Facebook" section.

![Facebook app configuration link](/img/documentation/facebook_14.jpg)

Paste the URL you have copied from Mission Kontrol into the "Canvas URL" field. The same URL goes into the "Secure Canvas URL" field. After that click on "Save Changes".

You are only one step away from playing your app on Facebook! Head back to Mission Kontrol, activate the Facebook venue and click on the "Open" link that appears after the activation.

As with any app on Facebook you will have to confirm the permissions settings of the app and proceed by clicking the "Go to App" button. This will only happen the first time you play the game.

Great Success! Bask in the glory of your labors. Your game is on Facebook!

At this point it is likely you want to share your game with select people. Go to the Facebook developer page again and click the "Developer Roles" link in the lefthand navigation.

![Facebook developer roles link](/img/documentation/facebook_19.jpg)

On the following page you can add friends or co-workers to become administrators, developers or testers of the Facebook app. This allows select people to access your game while Sandbox mode is enabled.

Now if your friend plays the game you will see him in the friend bar right below your game. If you don't see him immediately give our system a little while and refresh the page.

This concludes our tutorial. You are now familiar with the basics of Facebook app administration and our Mission Kontrol system. You have learned how to set up builds, configure and enable venues and how all the pieces comes together to form a game that you can play on Facebook.

[Further documentation](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/appsonfacebook/tutorial/) on application administration is provided by Facebook itself. If you want to dive deeper into the Quarter Spiral universe have a look at our [QS 101](/#/documentation/integration) guide that explains how to store data and show information on the Friend Bar for each friend. That way you can easily build a social leader board for your game.

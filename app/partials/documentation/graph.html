### Create a new relationship

#### Request

**POST** ``/entities/:UUID-SOURCE:/:RELATION-NAME:/:UUID-TARGET:``

##### Parameters

- **UUID-SOURCE** [REQUIRED]: The UUID of the source entity for the relationship
- **RELATION-NAME** [REQUIRED]: Name of the relation type (see [relation names](#relation-names))
- **UUID-TARGET** [REQUIRED]: The UUID of the target entity of the relationship

##### Body

JSON encoded options hash.

- **direction**: Direction of the relation. Possible values: ``both``
  (source relates to targte and target relates to source),
  ``incoming`` (target relates to source) and ``outgoing`` (source
relates to target)
- **meta**: An object with meta information on this relationship. When used on an already existing relationship this will update the existing meta information and only overwrite keys that are present in this request. All existing meta keys that are not present in this request will remain untouched.

#### Response

Will return status code 201 when created and 304 if the relation exists
already. If the relation exists but meta data was updated status code
200 is returned instead.

##### Body

JSON encoded array of objects which contains the new meta information (the array contains 2 elements if you create a relationship in ``both`` directions):

```javascript
[
  {
    "source": "peter",
    "target": "chess",
    "relation: "plays",
    "meta": {
      "location": "Paris"
    }
  }
]
```

#### Example

The relationship: ``Peter plays Chess`` would be created as a ``POST`` to: ``/entities/peter/plays/chess`` with the body ``{"direction": "outgoing"}``.

The relationship: ``Peter plays Chess in Space`` could be created as a ``POST`` to: ``/entities/peter/plays/chess`` with the body ``{"direction": "outgoing", "meta": {"location": "Space"}``.

### Check for an existing relationship

#### Request

**GET** ``/entities/:UUID-SOURCE:/:RELATION-NAME:/:UUID-TARGET:``

##### Parameters

- **UUID-SOURCE** [REQUIRED]: The UUID of the source entity for the relationship
- **RELATION-NAME** [REQUIRED]: Name of the relation type (see [relation names](#relation-names))
- **UUID-TARGET** [REQUIRED]: The UUID of the target entity of the relationship

##### Body

Empty.

#### Response

HTTP status code 200 if the relation exists. HTTP status code 404 if not.

##### Body

JSON encoded object of the form:

```javascript
{
  "source": "peter",
  "target": "chess",

  "meta": {
    "location": "Paris"
  }
}
```

#### Example

To find out if ``Peter plays chess`` send a ``GET`` to: ``/entities/peter/plays/chess``. If he does, it would return HTTP status code 200 otherwise status code 404.

##### Body

JSON encoded options hash.

- **direction**: Direction of the relation. Possible values: ``both``
  (source relates to targte and target relates to source),
  ``incoming`` (target relates to source) and ``outgoing`` (source
relates to target)
- **meta**: An object with meta information on this relationship. This object overwrites any existing meta information.

#### Response

HTTP status code 200 if the relation exists. HTTP status code 404 if not.

##### Body

JSON encoded array of objects which contains the new meta information (might be 2 elements when changing a relationship in ``both``directions):

```javascript

    "source": "peter",
    "target": "chess",
    "relation": "plays",
    "meta": {
      "location": "Dimension Z"

- **RELATION-NAME** [REQUIRED]: Name of the relation type (see [relation names](#relation-names))

##### Body

JSON encoded options hash.

- **direction** [OPTIONAL]: Direction of the related entities. Possible values: ``both``
  (entities relating to the given UUID and entities the given UUID is relating to), ``incoming`` (entities relating to the given UUID) and ``outgoing`` (default) (entities the given UUID is relating to).

#### Response

##### Body

A JSON encoded object of the related entities:

```javascript
[
  {
    "source": "peter",
    "target": "chess",

      "location": "Space"
    }
  },

    "relation: "plays",
    "meta": {
    }
  }
]
```

#### Example

``/entities/peter/plays``.

The response might be: ``["chess", "mahjong"]``.

To find out ``Who is playing chess`` send a ``GET`` to:
``/entities/chess/plays?direction=incoming``.

### Issue advanced queries to the graph

The used query language is Neo4J's [Cypher](http://docs.neo4j.org/chunked/milestone/cypher-query-lang.html). In order to make life a little bit easier the backend is already setting the ``START`` of the query to a node determined by the UUIDs specified.

#### Request

**GET** to ``/query/:UUID-SOURCE-1:/:UUID-SOURCE-2:/â€¦``

##### Parameters

- **UUID-SOURCE-N** [REQUIRED]: The UUID of an entity the query is relating to

##### Body

JSON encoded object.

###### Options

* **query**: Contains the *Cypher* query starting with the ``WHERE`` part. The ``START`` is already filled out by the backend in this way: ``START node1 = the_node_with_the_given_uuid_1, node2 = the_node_with_the_given_uuid_2``

#### Response

A JSON encoded array of arrays of whatever you have returned in the Cypher query.

*Hint*: It's very likely that you want to return single UUIDs.

#### Examples

Assuming that **my** user has the UUID ``12345`` and plays a game with the UUID ``67890``.

##### Games that my friends play

**GET** to ``/query/12345`` with the body:

```javascript
"query": "MATCH node0-[:friends]->friend-[:plays]->game RETURN game.uuid"
```

##### My friends who play that game, too, on Facebook
**GET** to ``/query/12345/67890`` with the body:

```javascript
"query": "MATCH node0-[:friends]->friend-[p:plays]->game WHERE game  = node1 AND p.venueFacebook! = true RETURN DISTINCT friend.uuid"
```

##### Developers of games my friends play on Facebook
**GET** to ``/query/12345`` with the body:

```javascript
"query" => "MATCH node1-[:friends]->()->[:plays]->()<-[:develops]->developer RETURN developer"
```

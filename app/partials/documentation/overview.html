By simply adding your game to Quarter Spiral you already enhance your game with features like the Friend Bar, support for multiple venues, etc.

It is easy to enhance your game even more by integrating with our advanced features. For example you can implement a high score that follows your players, or share items and values between games and show them for each player on the Friend Bar. Or you can store arbitrary information on a per player and per game basis.

The best way to get started is to follow one of the guides. You can also read up on the SDK that make working with our API easy. Or you can go straight for the raw API and roll your own implementations. Surprise us!

### SDK

[Our SDK](#/documentation/sdkIntro) currently supports [Flash](/#/documentation/sdkFlash) and [HTML](/#/documentation/sdkHtml). Unity is planned next.

### API

We have so far exposed just a [few parts](#/documentation/apis) of our API. We already have and use several more and will share those in due time.
